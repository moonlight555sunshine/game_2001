# 🎲 Dice Duel

A fun terminal-based dice game where you play against the computer. First to reach 2001 points wins — but beware of the tricky effects of rolling 7 or 11!

## 🧩 Game Rules

- Both you and the computer roll two six-sided dice each round.
- The sum of your dice is added to your score.
- From the second round onward, special rules apply:
  - If you roll a 7, your score is divided by 7. 
  - If you roll an 11, your score is multiplied by 11. 
  - Any other result simply gets added to your score. 
- The first to reach 2001 or more points wins the game.
